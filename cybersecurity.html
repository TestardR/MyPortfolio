        <h3 class="text-secondary">INDUSTRY OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p>
          According to Andrew van der Stock (Pluralsight, April 2018), two major
          changes are affecting the web development industry. First of all,
          developers are pushing a lot of server logic towards the client's,
          making more prone to attacks, as logic can more easily be leaked.
          Second of all, developers are moving to cloud services, which implies
          moving the state from the application to the cloud. Security has
          always been about protecting the state. It is now been moved around,
          and it is a huge change for security.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as browser security goes, the internet is safer but we are far
          away from a secure world. According to Alexa Top 1 Million Analysis
          (Scott Helme, August 2018), HTTPS has reached an increasing 51% of the
          top 1 Million websites, which is great news. HTTP Strict Transport
          Security (HSTS), forcing browsers to only interact with HTTPS
          connections, reaches an increasing 12.75%. Only 3.5% uses Content
          Security Policy (CSP). It increases steadily. Finally, Public Key
          Pinning is decreasing to a tiny 0.86% of the top 1 Million. It has
          been deprecated by Google as it has been misused causing "website suicide".

          TOP 3 CRITCAL WEB APPLICATION SECURITY RISKS
        </h3>
        <p>
          According to OWASP (2017), the three major security risks face by
          developers are 1. Injection, 2. Broken Authentication, 3. Sensitive
          Data Exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Even though the likelihood of SQL injection has considerably
          dropped, the rise of NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB) has given
          momentum to NoSQL injections. Developers have to prepare for this. SQL
          or NoSQL excluded, injections can have a huge impact and cannot be
          discarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Password breached is very common. Passwords chosen by users are too
          often duplicates and easy to breach. "123456" is an example of a
          typical password used over 22 390 492 times up to 2018
          (haveibeenpwned.com, 2018). Technology should move towards making
          passwords reusable or different. Furthermore, users have to be
          informed if they have been breached.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Data protection has be enhanced to meet regulations, such the EU
          GDPR (2018). Indeed, sexual orientation, health records, bank
          credentials or even political affiliation are critical to users.
          "Rather than directly attacking crypted contents, attackers steal
          keys, execute man-inthe-middle attacks, or steal clear text data off
          the server, while in transit, or from the user’s client (often the
          browser)." (OWASP, 2018, p. 9). Data has to be properly protected.

        <br />
        <h3 class="text-secondary">NEXT STEPS ?</h3>
        <p>
          1. CI/CD has to be enhanced and monitored. Continuous integration,
          continuous deployment as well as unit testing are at the cornerstone
          of cybersecurity for developers. Technologies such as Mocha and Jest
          for testing or Appveyor and Travis for continuous integration are
          widespread. Well programmed and implemented, they will allow
          developers to protect users from evolving attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Business developers should produce metrics to point out issues
          regarding security threats. They should be quick to set security
          standards and quality training for their developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Developers should move to or update their new frameworks.
          Technologies such as Angular and React are built upon the latest
          technology standards. They integrate built-in protection for modern
          attacks, such as injections. That is why injections are less common,
          not because developers actually learned how to deal with them...
